## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* It's interesting that having a growth mindset emphasis' on setting S.M.A.R.T goals, which emphasizes breaking down goals into small achievable tasks. This is very similar to the way in which were are taught to breakdown coding tasks, into small solvable problems. It makes sense that these two go hand in hand.
* I think it's very prudent that the article mentions focusing on the process, instead of only the end result. Because of the nature of coding and all of the hiccups that go along the way, it's important to evaluate all of the skills and tools you've learned along the way to completely your end goal or project.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
*  I think i currently demonstrate a growth mindset in a lot of ways, first foremost the first point of believing that I can improve my coding with effort and practice. This probably would apply to most people who have enrolled in Turing as that is what we are setting out to do. I also believe that understanding mistakes are part of the process is something I am very accustomed too. During my previous career as a trader, mistakes or losses were something that I had to deal with frequently, and understand that they were part of getting better is something that I am very used to. I think something I could potentially work is, focusing on the process and making sure to realize that while the finished product is important its also very important to take a second to evaluate everything I learned along the way.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* A data structure that stores items by associated keys.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```
pet_store = {toys: 4, beds: 21, bones: 3, leashes: 12}
```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
states.fetch(:"IA")
```
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```
states.keys
```
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* A good time to use hashes would be to store passwords for different websites. As each ID has a unique password pair.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
* I don't have any questions this work was very thorough.
