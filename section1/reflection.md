## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
* A lot of the habits of super learners are things that are preached by educators. For instance, reading a lot is something that I remember teachers mentioniong all the way back through highschool. I specifically think taking the short breaks early and often is something I would want to incorporate more into how I work. I generally like to sit and work for prolonged periods and ride the momentum. I would also add that taking a step bac kand appreciating yourself for all that you've learned is very important. Its important to give yourself credit for learning.
