## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I feel as if i'm in the middle, of asking too soon and waiting to long. I tend to like to try and figure out as much as I can on my own and then ask questions if there are parents that I cant seem to grasp. I feel like the tip to write your question out before asking is actually a great idea, I plan on using that going forward.  

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
* A statement that evaluates something as true or false.
  1.
  ```
    If minutes > 8
      print "9"
    end
  ```
  2.
```
  If minutes == 9
       print "9"
  end
```
  3.
```
  If name == "David"
      print "It's me"
  end
```
1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
* If you want to create a branch in the code, where certain things run if certain things happen.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if x
    puts "x"
  end
```
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
* Do put multiple conditions to if statements you have to use elsif and else statements.
1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
if x
  p "x"
elsif y
  p "y"
else
  p "z"
end
```
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
* Yes you can also combine conditional statements with logical operators.

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
* A method is a collection of code that performs a desired task and returns the result.
1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  p "Sam I am"
end
```
1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```
1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

* hello_someone(Sam)

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
* I don't really have any questions, the material was very thorough.
